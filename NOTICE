Not-Going-To-Be-Commons-SSL is based off of and contains modified source files
from Not-Yet-Commons-SSL, which is distributed under the terms of the 
Apache License, Version 2.0. The following files have been modified:

    File: src/main/java/org/apache/commons/ssl/ASN1Util.java
    
    Changes: Removing Bouncy Castle classes and linking to the JAR instead.


    File: src/main/java/org/apache/commons/ssl/KeyStoreBuilder.java
    
    Changes: Fixing tryJKS to correctly return null for a potential PKCS12 file
             with no key entry. This happens with cacerts in Java 9+ because of
             the changes in JEP 229, because both JKS and PKCS12 files can now
             be loaded using either the JKS or PKCS12 keystore type.
             Replacing direct System.out calls with Logger calls.
             Removing Bouncy Castle classes and linking to the JAR instead.


    File: src/main/java/org/apache/commons/ssl/PKCS8Key.java
    
    Changes: Removing Bouncy Castle classes and linking to the JAR instead.


    File: src/main/java/org/apache/commons/ssl/TrustMaterial.java
    
    Changes: Replacing direct printStackTrace calls with Logger calls.


    Files: src/main/java/org/apache/commons/ssl/org/bouncycastle/*
    
    Changes: Removing Bouncy Castle classes and linking to the JAR instead.
